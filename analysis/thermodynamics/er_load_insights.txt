ER SYSTEM LOAD ANALYSIS - COMPREHENSIVE REPORT
Meridian City Hospital Emergency Department
================================================================================

Report Generated: 2025-11-10 17:21:05
Analysis Period: 2025-01-01 01:00:00 to 2025-04-01 04:00:00
Duration: 90 days


================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

The analysis covers a 90-day period of ER operations,
simulating hourly system load based on patient arrivals and exits. The ER system
demonstrates cyclical load patterns with significant variability across hours and days.

Key Findings:
- The ER operates with highly dynamic patient flow
- Load ranges from 0 to 68 patients in queue
- Average operational load: 19.9 patients
- The system experiences peak pressures lasting up to 8 continuous hours


================================================================================
1. LOAD BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Load Pattern Classification: CYCLICAL with significant variability

Peak Activity:
  - Hour of Day: 11:00-11:59 (avg 46.3 patients)
  - Maximum recorded: 68 patients
  - Std Dev: 7.66

Trough Activity:
  - Hour of Day: 2:00-2:59 (avg 4.3 patients)
  - Std Dev: 1.91

Interpretation:
The ER shows a predictable cyclical pattern with peak loads during 11:00-11:59 hours,
indicating consistent surge periods that likely correspond to business hours. The load is relatively
stable with a coefficient of variation of 75.67%, suggesting
moderate operational predictability.


================================================================================
2. PEAKS AND RECOVERY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

High-Load Period Definition: System Load > Mean + 1 Std Dev (34.95 patients)

Peak Statistics:
  - Number of high-load events: 100
  - Maximum peak duration: 8 consecutive hours
  - Average peak duration: 4.6 hours

Recovery Dynamics:
The system exhibits strong recovery capability,
with peaks lasting an average of 4.6 hours.
This indicates moderate throughput
and acceptable operational management.

Critical Insight:
Periods exceeding 8 hours of sustained high load represent critical
operational stress points requiring immediate intervention or resource augmentation.


================================================================================
3. RESPONSE DYNAMICS - LAG CORRELATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Lag Correlation Results (Exits vs Arrivals):

  lag_1_hours: +0.6733
  lag_2_hours: +0.8232
  lag_3_hours: +0.9077
  lag_4_hours: +0.7739
  lag_5_hours: +0.6270
  lag_6_hours: +0.4639

Interpretation:
The maximum correlation (+0.9077) occurs at lag_3_hours, indicating that
exit patterns best align with arrival patterns from 3 hours prior.

Operational Meaning:
- High positive correlation: Exits respond quickly to arrivals (efficient throughput)
- Time lag indicates: Average patient processing time from arrival to exit
- Implication: Staff capacity appears well-matched with patient flow

Recommendations:
The exit lag of approximately 3 hours suggests that patients take
this long to progress through the ER. Consider analyzing:
- Triage efficiency
- Doctor availability bottlenecks
- Bed turnover times
- Discharge processing delays


================================================================================
4. SYSTEM EFFICIENCY - THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

Overall Throughput Metrics:
  - Total Arrivals (90 days): 15,000 patients
  - Total Exits (90 days): 15,000 patients
  - Throughput Ratio: 100.00%
  - Backlog: 0 patients remaining

Daily Throughput Analysis:
  - Average daily ratio: 100.01%
  - Range: 95.11% to 106.38%

Efficiency Assessment:
A throughput ratio of 100.00% indicates that approximately
100.0% of arriving patients exit daily. 
The high ratio
suggests efficient throughput.

Daily variability of 11.27% indicates
operational inconsistency, possibly due to staffing variations or admission patterns.

5. STRATEGIC INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Key Operational Findings:

1. CAPACITY & LOAD MANAGEMENT
   - Peak load of 68 patients occurs at Friday 11:00
   - 95th percentile load: 47 patients
   - Volatility is high (rolling 24-hr std dev: 20.98)
   
   ACTION ITEMS:
   ✓ Increase staffing during identified peak hours (11:00-11:59)
   ✓ Implement surge protocols when load exceeds 47 patients
   ✓ Cross-train staff to handle surge capacity

2. DISCHARGE & EXIT OPTIMIZATION
   - Current exit lag: approximately 3 hours after arrival
   - Throughput ratio: 100.00%
   
   ACTION ITEMS:
   ✓ Streamline discharge processes to reduce patient dwell time
   ✓ Implement bed management protocols
   ✓ Consider fast-track pathways for lower-acuity patients
   ✓ Improve coordination between doctor and exit/admission decisions

3. TRIAGE & FLOW EFFICIENCY
   - Load stability coefficient of variation: 75.67%
   - Predictable patterns enable proactive scheduling
   
   ACTION ITEMS:
   ✓ Align triage staff capacity with predictable hourly patterns
   ✓ Pre-position resources before known peak hours
   ✓ Implement dynamic triage to prioritize faster-resolution cases

4. RESOURCE ALLOCATION
   - Highest utilization: 11:00-11:59 (mean 46.3 patients)
   - Lowest utilization: 2:00-2:59 (mean 4.3 patients)
   - Peak-to-trough ratio: 10.9x
   
   ACTION ITEMS:
   ✓ Implement shift overlaps during transition hours
   ✓ Use part-time/on-call staff for surge periods
   ✓ Consider shift scheduling optimization to match demand patterns

5. PREDICTIVE MONITORING
   - System load is ('highly', 'moderately', 'weakly')[min(2, int((metrics['overall_throughput_ratio']*100)/50))] predictable
   - Implement real-time load monitoring dashboards
   
   ACTION ITEMS:
   ✓ Set alerts at 75th percentile (32) and 90th percentile (43)
   ✓ Activate surge protocols when 95th percentile exceeded
   ✓ Enable staff to anticipate capacity constraints
