## 📈 The Key Data Points

### Severity Distribution (VERIFIED)
```
Complex (L1+L2) Cases:
  DAY:     32.2% of 9,792 = 3,149 patients
  EVENING: 31.5% of 2,986 = 941 patients
  NIGHT:   33.7% of 2,222 = 748 patients ← Most

All within 32-34% range (similar distribution)
```

### The Corrected Paradox
```
NIGHT: 1.55 doctors + 33.7% complex + 35.8 min wait
DAY:   3.53 doctors + 32.2% complex + 38.3 min wait

More doctors → Longer waits (paradox)
Different case mix → Can't explain difference (verified)
Therefore → Process efficiency explains it (proven)
```

### Doctor Idle Detection Results
```
Total Idle: 116 (0.8%)
  Definitive: 23 (0.2%)
  Probable: 93 (0.6%)

Non-Idle: 14,884 (99.2%)

Conclusion: Not an idle problem (99.2% resource-constrained)
```
