# Setup Complete: Bottleneck Analysis Project

**Date:** November 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready for Phase 1 Data Exploration

---

## What We've Created

### **1. Comprehensive Methodology** 📋
**File:** `/Bottleneck/METHODOLOGY.md`

**Contains:**
- How we'll approach the randomness problem
- 4 industry approaches (Deterministic → Process Mining → Queuing Theory → ML)
- Our chosen hybrid approach
- Bed occupancy algorithm with assumptions
- What success looks like

**Key Insight:** We acknowledge that randomness exists, document our assumptions, and provide a path to address it if needed.

---

### **2. Main Analysis Notebook** 📓
**File:** `/Bottleneck/bottleneck_analysis.ipynb`

**Structure:**
- **Section 1: Data Exploration** (READY) ✅
  - Load datasets
  - Understand wait time distributions
  - Check patterns by severity/shift/load
  - Visualizations
  - Initial findings

- **Section 2-5:** Skeleton ready for Phase 2-5 (Bed Occupancy → Doctor Idle → Root Cause → Recommendations)

**Philosophy:** Single notebook, append-only. No separate scripts.

### **3. Progress Tracking** 📊
**File:** `/Bottleneck/FINDINGS.md`

**Purpose:**
- Tracks discoveries as we make them
- Checklist of questions answered
- Appends findings, never deletes

**File:** `/Bottleneck/README.md`

**Contains:**
- Project overview
- Phase breakdown
- Key concepts
- How to read results
- Quick reference

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Doctor "Idleness" is CONDITIONAL, Not Simple

**READ THIS FIRST:** `/Bottleneck/DOCTOR_IDLE_DEFINITION.md`

**Key Point:**
Do NOT assume: "Doctor finished + 10-min buffer + Patient waiting = Doctor Idle"

**INSTEAD check ALL simultaneously:**
- Doctor has capacity? (idle_doctors > 0)
- Patient is waiting? (waiting_patients > 0)
- Bed IS available? (available_beds > 0)

**Only if ALL are TRUE:** → Coordination failure (process fixable)

**If ANY fails:** → Resource constraint (needs hiring/expansion)

**Why this matters:**
- Prevents false conclusions
- Distinguishes between fixable process vs. capital-needs
- Gives management confidence in analysis

See DOCTOR_IDLE_DEFINITION.md for full walkthrough with examples.

## The Approach We've Documented

### **Understanding Randomness**

We identified that your ER model depends on **4 factors:**
```
Wait = f(Severity, Test Turnaround, Room Availability, Staff Workload)
```

Most analysis tools assume ONE bottleneck. We can't.

**Industry Solutions:**
1. **Deterministic (Ours - Phase 1-4):** Define rules, acknowledge limitations
2. **Process Mining (If needed):** Track actual flow, find real bottleneck
3. **Queuing Simulation (If needed):** Model ER mathematically
4. **Machine Learning (If needed):** Learn patterns from data

### **Our Bed Occupancy Algorithm**

**Key innovation:** We'll calculate when beds are occupied (patient Doctor_Seen → Exit) and when available.

**Logic:**
```
Bottleneck instance =
  Patient waiting (Triage End → Doctor Seen)
  AND Available doctor (finished + 10-min buffer)
  AND Available bed (occupancy < capacity)
  → This is a PROCESS failure, not resource failure
```

### **Handling Unknowns**

We can't measure:
- ✗ Test result timing (is patient waiting for lab?)
- ✗ Room assignment (which patient in which room?)
- ✗ Doctor specialization (can any doctor see any patient?)

**Solution:** Document these as assumptions, flag instances we can't explain, propose advanced methods if needed.

## Your Role at Each Phase

### **Phase 1: Data Exploration** (Now Running)
- **You:** Can start running the notebook
- **AI:** Will help debug, explain patterns
- **Goal:** "What does the data show?"

### **Phase 2: Bed Occupancy** (Next)
- **You:** May want to validate bed assignment logic
- **AI:** Will implement algorithm
- **Goal:** "Are beds a bottleneck?"

### **Phase 3: Doctor Idle** (Then)
- **You:** May identify specific cases to deep-dive on
- **AI:** Will calculate idle instances
- **Goal:** "When are doctors available but patients waiting?"

### **Phase 4: Root Cause** (After)
- **You:** Will interpret which causes matter most
- **AI:** Will categorize findings
- **Goal:** "What's the real problem?"

### **Phase 5: Recommendations** (Finally)
- **You:** Will decide on next steps
- **AI:** Will recommend industry approach
- **Goal:** "What do we do about randomness?"

## Key Files & Their Purpose

| File | Purpose | When to Read |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `README.md` | Quick start guide | Before starting |
| `METHODOLOGY.md` | Detailed reasoning | When designing the study |
| `bottleneck_analysis.ipynb` | Main analysis | Run sequentially |
| `FINDINGS.md` | Append results here | After each phase |

---

## Next Immediate Steps

### **Option A: Run Phase 1 Now**
1. Open `bottleneck_analysis.ipynb`
2. Configure kernel (if needed)
3. Run Section 1 cells sequentially
4. Watch for patterns in output/visualizations
5. Note initial findings

### **Option B: Review Methodology First**
1. Read `METHODOLOGY.md` carefully
2. Check if assumptions align with your understanding
3. Ask clarifying questions about bed assignment, data gaps, etc.
4. Then run notebook

**Recommendation:** Option B → Option A. Understand the thinking first, then see data.

## Important Design Decisions

### **Single Notebook, Append-Only**
✅ Everything in one place  
✅ Easy to trace thought process  
✅ No scattered scripts to maintain  
✓ Markdown files for explanation/findings  

### **Deterministic + Probabilistic**
✅ Start with what we CAN measure  
✅ Document where we CAN'T  
✅ Propose advanced methods if randomness is high  

### **Assumptions-First Thinking**
✅ Clear what we're assuming  
✅ Easy to revise if assumptions wrong  
✅ Defensible for management

## Potential Discoveries Ahead

**Scenario A: Bed Shortage**
- Finding: High occupancy, limited availability
- Action: Need more beds or faster throughput

**Scenario B: Doctor Shortage**
- Finding: High patient-per-doctor ratio
- Action: Need more doctors or better scheduling

**Scenario C: Process Failure**
- Finding: Resources available but patients waiting
- Action: Fix workflow, coordination, assignments

**Scenario D: Randomness Dominates**
- Finding: Can't explain >50% of variance
- Action: Propose Process Mining or Simulation

## Success Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Goal | Success = |
|-------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Understand data | Identify main patterns |
| 2 | Identify constraints | Know if beds are limiting |
| 3 | Find inefficiencies | Quantify "avoidable" waits |
| 4 | Root causes | Explain >70% of variance |
| 5 | Recommendations | Clear path forward |

## Questions You Might Have

**Q: Why so much methodology upfront?**  
A: Because you said "don't hurry, solve and study." This ensures rigorous thinking before diving into code.

**Q: What if my assumptions are wrong?**  
A: Document them, test sensitivity, revise. That's the scientific method.

**Q: Will this find the "real" bottleneck?**  
A: Likely yes for Phases 1-4. If randomness is high, Phase 5 recommends advanced methods.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: Phase 1: 30-60 min (explore data). Phases 2-5: Depends on findings. Could be quick if clear pattern, or need simulation if complex.
