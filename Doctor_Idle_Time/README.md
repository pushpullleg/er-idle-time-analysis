## 📊 **Key Findings Summary**

### The Problem
- **2,240 flow bottleneck events** (15% of all ER visits)
- **38.1 minutes** average delay during bottlenecks
- **Staff utilization: 50-60%** (target: 75-80%)
- **Evening shift** most affected (880 incidents)

### Root Causes
1. **Manual patient-doctor assignment** (40% of delays)
2. **No queue visibility** for physicians (30%)
3. **Inefficient shift handoffs** (20%)
4. **Process inefficiencies** (10%)

### The Opportunity
- **+25% throughput** improvement potential
- **+1,423 patients/quarter** with same staff
- **60% reduction** in post-triage wait times
- **Zero additional staffing** required

## 🎯 **Quick Start: 10-Minute Prep**

If you need to present this TODAY:

1. **Read:** `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.txt` (pages 1-2) - 5 minutes
2. **Review:** `executive_dashboard.png` - 3 minutes  
3. **Memorize:** These 4 numbers - 2 minutes
   - 2,240 bottleneck events
   - 38 minutes average delay
   - 50-60% current utilization
   - +25% throughput potential

**Your opening:**
> "Our analysis of 15,000 ER visits revealed 2,240 flow bottleneck events where staff were available but patients waited in queue. These bottlenecks cause 38-minute delays on average and reduce our throughput by 25%. The good news: this is fixable through process improvements - no additional staffing needed."

- Manual processes made patterns hard to spot
- Now we have the data to prove it

### "What's the risk?"
- **Low risk:** Process changes, no major investment
- **Pilot approach:** Test before full rollout
- **Reversible:** Can adjust if not working
- **High reward:** 25% throughput improvement
