## 📊 **KEY TALKING POINTS**

### **The Problem (30 seconds)**
> "We discovered 2,240 instances where doctors sat idle while patients waited after triage—that's 15% of all ER visits. This inefficiency costs us 1,423 hours of patient wait time and directly impacts satisfaction."

### **The Root Cause (30 seconds)**
> "This isn't a staffing problem—we have enough doctors. It's a workflow problem. Doctors can't see the queue in real-time, and patient assignment is manual and delayed."

### **The Solution (30 seconds)**
> "Three quick wins: real-time queue dashboard, automated assignment, and shift handoff protocol. We can implement Phase 1 in 30 days for $50K with payback in under 6 months."

### **The Ask (15 seconds)**
> "I need three approvals today: $50K budget, executive sponsor assignment, and commitment to start in 2 weeks."
