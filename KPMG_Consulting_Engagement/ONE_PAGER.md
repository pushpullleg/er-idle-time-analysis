# MERIDIAN CITY ER EFFICIENCY | ONE-PAGE EXECUTIVE BRIEF
**KPMG Consulting Engagement** | November 2025

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

**Meridian City ER has a $5–6M annual opportunity** to increase throughput by 25–35% without new physicians through process optimization.

**Current Reality:**
- 15,000 visits/quarter (6.9 patients/hour)
- 172-minute average ED length of stay
- 38.6-minute average post-triage wait ← **BOTTLENECK**
- Doctors only 50% utilized during peak waits (1,387 wasted patient-hours Q1)

**The Gap:** 2,179 instances where doctors were idle but patients waited (14.5% of visits)

---

## THE ROOT CAUSE (NOT STAFFING)

**Theory of Constraints:** Throughput is limited by the bottleneck, not individual stages.

| Stage | Duration | % of LOS | Queue? |
|-------|----------|---------|--------|
| Registration | 10 min | 5.8% | No |
| Triage | 13 min | 7.3% | No |
| **Post-triage wait** | **39 min** | **22.4%** | **YES** |
| **Doctor + Treatment** | **107 min** | **62.3%** | **YES** |

**Why the queue?** Doctor stage is slow (107 min = 62% of LOS), not because of staffing, but because:
- ❌ Manual patient-to-doctor assignment (no queue visibility)
- ❌ Doctors don't know who's waiting next
- ❌ Coordination delays (avg 2–5 min per patient)
- ❌ No fast-track for low-acuity cases

---

## THE SOLUTION: PROCESS, NOT HIRING

**Scenario 2 (RECOMMENDED):** Process fixes + 1 NP

| Intervention | Impact | Cost |
|--------------|--------|------|
| Real-time queue board | Doctors see waiting patients instantly | Included in $80K/yr system |
| Auto-dispatch rules | System routes patient → available doctor | Included in tech |
| Shift handoff playbook | Structured 15-min briefing (vs. chaotic) | Process only |
| Room turnover SOP | 5-min max (vs. 8+ min random) | Process only |
| NP fast-track | 1 NP handles 20% low-acuity cases | $150K/yr salary |

**Result:** Post-triage wait drops 73% (39→8 min), throughput rises 32% (6.9→9.1 patients/hr)

| Metric | Current | Target | Change |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Throughput | 6.9/hr | 9.1/hr | +2.2 (+32%) |
| Post-triage wait | 38.6 min | 8–10 min | ↓73% |
| Doctor utilization | 50% | 75% | +25 pts |
| Annual visits | 61,000 | 79,900 | +18,900 |

---

## THE FINANCIAL CASE

**Investment: $807.5K (Year 1)**
- Queue system: $80K/yr
- EHR integration: $120K
- KPMG consulting (16 weeks): $400K
- Training & change mgmt: $60K
- 1 NP salary (prorated): $75K
- Contingency: $82.5K

**Return: $15.1M annually (from throughput gain)**
- +18,900 additional visits/year
- @ $800 average revenue/visit
- **Less investment cost: $14.3M net annual benefit**

**Payback: <3 weeks** (21 days from pilot launch)

**5-year NPV: ~$65M** (10% discount rate)

---

## THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1–12): Pilot**
- Days 1–14: System procurement, clinical design, staff training
- Days 15–42: Day shift pilot (6 weeks), real-time KPI tracking, daily standups
- Days 43–56: Analysis, go/no-go gate decision

**Phase 2 (Weeks 13–20): Scale (if go approved)**
- Roll out to evening, then night shifts
- Adjust dispatch rules for low-volume periods
- Monitor sustained improvement

**Phase 3 (Months 4–6): Evaluate Staffing Augmentation**
- Monitor demand and capacity utilization
- If needed: Add 1 MD + expand NP coverage (Scenario 3 = +65% throughput)

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (80-Day Pilot)

| KPI | Target | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| **Throughput** | 8.0+ patients/hour | Must achieve |
| **Post-triage wait** | <12 minutes | Must achieve |
| **Doctor utilization** | 70%+ | Must achieve |
| **Staff adoption** | 7+/10 comfort | Must achieve |
| **Safety** | Zero incidents | Must achieve |

**Decision:** All criteria met → Full scale-out. Otherwise → Extend pilot or redesign.

---

## RISK MITIGATION

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Staff resistance | Early engagement, transparent comms, training, feedback loops |
| Tech failures | Proven vendor, fallback to manual process, 24/7 support |
| Bottleneck shifts | Weekly KPI reviews, adjust as needed |
| Over-hiring | Phased approach—test process first, defer staffing decisions |

---

## KEY INSIGHT

*In a constrained system, making the fast stages faster doesn't help. You must fix the bottleneck.*

**Making registration 30% faster: ≈0% throughput improvement** (already fast)
**Fixing doctor assignment & fast-track: +32% throughput improvement** (is the bottleneck)

---

## NEXT STEPS (THIS WEEK)

1. **Monday:** Executive kickoff (30 min) – review this brief + Executive_Summary.md
2. **Tuesday:** Approve Scenario 2 (process + 1 NP)
3. **Wednesday:** Allocate $807.5K budget
4. **Thursday:** Confirm pilot start (target: Nov 24, 2025, Week 5)
5. **Friday:** Begin vendor evaluation (queue management system)

---

## RECOMMENDATION

**APPROVE Scenario 2.** Launch pilot in Week 5. Validate process benefits first. Defer staffing decisions until post-pilot (Month 4). 

**Why?** Maximize ROI ($14.3M benefit), minimize hiring risk, test NP model pilot-risk-free, validate that process is the true bottleneck.
