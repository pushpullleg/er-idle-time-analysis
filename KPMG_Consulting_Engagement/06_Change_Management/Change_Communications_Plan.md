# Change Communications & Engagement Plan
## Meridian City ER Efficiency Transformation

---

## Communication Strategy Overview

**Objective:** Build awareness, buy-in, and sustained adoption of ER workflow improvements across all stakeholder groups.

**Key Message:** *"We're fixing how we assign patients to doctors—not changing how you work, but removing barriers so you can work faster and patients experience less waiting."*

**Tone:** Hopeful, data-driven, action-oriented (not top-down mandate)

---

## Stakeholder Segmentation & Messaging

### 1. **Executive Leadership (Board, C-Suite)**

**Stakeholders:** Board members, CFO, COO, Chief Medical Officer

**Key Concerns:**
- ROI & financial impact
- Risk & board-level visibility
- Strategic alignment

**Message Template:**
> *"Meridian ER has a $5–6M annual opportunity to improve throughput 25–35% without new hires. We've identified the bottleneck (doctor assignment/queue visibility), designed a low-risk pilot, and can deliver results in 12 weeks. The investment ($840K consulting + 1 NP) pays back in under 3 weeks."*

**Touchpoints:**
- **Month 0 (Pre-Pilot):** 30-min executive brief + 1-page fact sheet
- **Month 2 (Pilot Week 4):** Steering committee update (green light or pause?)
- **Month 3 (Post-Pilot):** Results presentation + go/no-go for full rollout
- **Quarterly:** Board dashboard showing throughput, revenue, KPIs

**Deliverables:**
- Executive summary (3 pgs)
- One-page fact pack (financial impact)
- Pilot results deck (15 slides)
- Monthly KPI scorecard

---

### 2. **Clinical Leadership (ER Medical Director, Nursing Lead, Quality)**

**Stakeholders:** ER physicians, nurse manager, patient safety officer

**Key Concerns:**
- Patient safety & quality (will dispatch system make errors?)
- Clinician workflow impact (will it help or hurt their day?)
- Autonomy & clinical judgment (am I losing control to a computer?)

**Message Template:**
> *"This is a queuing system, not a clinical decision system. You still make all care decisions. What changes: instead of asking 'who's next?' or waiting for a page, you see a real-time list. You assign yourself or let the system suggest the next patient. It's faster, smarter, and keeps your clinical judgment intact."*

**Touchpoints:**
- **Week 1 (Pre-Launch):** 90-min working session: review dispatch rules, design edge cases, confirm safety protocols
- **Week 2 (Pre-Launch):** 60-min clinical education session on system design
- **Week 3 (Launch):** Bedside champions available during first day of go-live
- **Daily (Pilot):** 15-min clinical huddle (feedback, tweaks, safety check-in)
- **Weekly:** Steering committee (you're on it, helping drive decisions)

**Deliverables:**
- Dispatch rules flowchart (clinical validation sign-off)
- Safety protocol document
- System demo video (5 min, showing actual use)
- Weekly reflection template (what's working, what's hard?)

---

### 3. **Frontline Staff (Doctors, Nurses, Registration, Triage, Housekeeping)**

**Stakeholders:** 40–50 ER staff across all roles

**Key Concerns:**
- Will I break the system? (learning curve anxiety)
- How does this change my job? (uncertainty about new normal)
- Will this help patients or just add work? (skepticism)

**Message Template:**
> *"Starting next week, we're turning on a new queue board that shows all waiting patients. No more asking around; you'll see it on the screen or get a notification. No more manual room assignments; the system suggests 'Doctor A to Room 3.' You can accept or override. It's designed to make your day easier and get patients to doctors faster. Training starts tomorrow. Questions? Ask anytime."*

**Touchpoints:**
- **Week 1 (Pre-Launch):** 45-min group training (all shifts attend)
- **Week 1 (Pre-Launch):** 10-min 1-on-1 walkthroughs (role-specific)
- **Day 1 (Launch):** Cheerleaders & champions on floor (answer live questions)
- **Daily (Week 1–2):** "How's it going?" check-ins (casual, low-pressure)
- **Weekly:** Feedback session (anonymous survey + optional open forum)

**Deliverables:**
- Training deck (20 slides, 45 min)
- Role-specific checklists (laminated quick-refs)
- System quick-start guide (1 pager, posted at every workstation)
- FAQ sheet (anticipated Q&As)
- Feedback survey (Likert scale + open-ended)

---

### 4. **Support Functions (IT, HR, Finance)**

**Stakeholders:** IT help desk, HR (hiring NP), Finance (budget tracking)

**Key Concerns:**
- Am I ready to support this? (capability)
- What's my role? (clarity)
- Will this create more tickets/work? (workload)

**Message Template:**
> *"We're adding a patient queue management system (vendor = TBD) starting Week 3. Your IT team will handle setup, training, and support. HR will help onboard the new NP. Finance will track project spend and ROI. Please flag any capacity concerns now so we can plan."*

**Touchpoints:**
- **Week 1:** Kick-off meeting with each support team
- **Ongoing:** Weekly standup (issues, action items)
- **Monthly:** Budget & progress review

---

## Communication Timeline

### Pre-Pilot (Weeks 1–2)

**Week 1: Announcement**
- All-hands email from CMO: "We're launching a new efficiency pilot to reduce patient waits"
- Attached: 1-page fact sheet + FAQ
- Tone: Exciting, data-backed, action-oriented

**Sample Email:**
```
SUBJECT: New Initiative: Meridian ER Gets a Smarter Queue System

Dear ER Team,

We've analyzed 15,000 patient visits and found a clear opportunity: 
patients wait too long after triage because doctors don't know they're 
waiting. Starting Nov 20, we're fixing this with a real-time queue board 
and smarter patient-to-doctor assignments.

What's changing:
✓ You'll see a visual dashboard showing waiting patients
✓ System suggests your next patient (you can accept/override)
✓ Shift handoffs become 15-min structured briefings

Why now:
- Patients will see doctors 70% faster (38 min → 9 min wait)
- Your day gets easier (no more "who's next?" chaos)
- Hospital gains capacity for 40–50 more patients/day without new hires

Training starts next week. You'll get hands-on demo time before go-live.

Questions? Reply to this email or come to the open Q&A session 
Thursday 3 PM in the break room.

Thanks for your continued excellence,
[CMO Name]
```

**Week 1: Info Sessions**
- Open Q&A forum (3 sessions, all shifts covered): 30 min each
- In-person system demo (optional, on-floor): queue board walkthrough
- One-pagers posted in break room, locker room, staff areas

**Week 2: Training Begins**
- Mandatory 45-min group training (all staff by role)
- Role-specific 10-min 1-on-1 walkthroughs (registration, triage, doctor, nurse, housekeeping)
- Role-specific laminated quick-ref cards at every workstation

---

**Week 3: Launch Day**

**Morning Kickoff (7 AM):**
- 30-min pep talk with all day-shift staff
- Live demo of queue board + dispatch
- "Cheerleaders" positioned in ER (KPMG consultant + clinical lead)

**Comms Flow:**
- Signage at entrance: "New workflow in use today – bear with us!"
- Dashboard visible in break room: real-time pilot KPIs
- Shift huddle debriefs (5 min): "How did it feel? Any blockers?"

**Week 4–7: Weekly Communications**

**Every Monday Morning:**
- Email with KPI update (throughput, wait times, staff adoption score)
- 1-pager: "Here's what's working; here's what we're tweaking"
- Highlight: "Great catch by nurse X on dispatch rule Y—implementing this week!"

**Every Thursday Afternoon:**

- "Wins of the week" shared in huddle (celebrate progress)

**Weekly "Pulse Check" (Anonymous Survey):**
- 5 Likert questions + 1 open-ended
- Results shared back next Monday
- Feedback directly acted upon (or explain why not)

**Sample Weekly Comms Template:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEEK 2 PILOT UPDATE: ON TRACK! 🟢
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE NUMBERS:
✓ Throughput: 7.8 patients/hr (87% of target 8.0)
✓ Post-triage wait: 11.2 min (approach target 10 min)
✓ Doctor utilization: 65% (improving from 50%)
✓ Staff adoption: 72/100 comfort rating

WHAT'S WORKING:
• Queue board reducing "who's next?" confusion
• Shift handoffs now structured—info loss down 50%
• Room turnover improving (7 min avg vs. 8 min)

CHALLENGES WE'RE FIXING:
• ESI-4 dispatch rule over-optimistic (tweaking criteria)
• Queue board notifications delayed sometimes (IT investigating)
• Fast-track room assignment needs clarity (designing workflow Friday)

YOUR FEEDBACK:
"Love seeing the queue. Not asking around anymore!" —Dr. Chen
"Handoff structure helps. Transitions cleaner now." —Charge Nurse
"Still confusing when system suggests vs. I decide. Please clarify." → ACTION: Retraining coming Friday

NEXT WEEK:
• Refine ESI-4 dispatch rule
• Fix queue board notification lag
• Rotate in second NP for fast-track backup

QUESTIONS? Reply to this email or catch us at Thursday debrief.

Thank you for making this pilot a success!
```

**Week 8: Final Week Celebration & Decision Point**

- All-hands debrief (30 min): results + next steps
- "Wins gallery" (5 min each): staff highlights on how new workflow helped
- Go/No-Go decision announced with rationale
- Rollout roadmap preview (if go)

---

### Post-Pilot (Week 9–12)

**Week 9: Results Announcement**
- Formal presentation to board (30 min)
- All-hands meeting (30 min): explain results, celebrate wins, outline next phase
- Press release (optional): "Meridian ER Cuts Patient Wait Times by X%"

**Sample All-Hands Script:**
```
"Team, we did it. In 6 weeks, we:
• Reduced post-triage wait from 38 minutes to 9 minutes
• Improved doctor utilization from 50% to 72%
• Increased throughput from 6.9 to 8.2 patients/hour
• Maintained zero safety incidents
• Earned 72/100 staff comfort rating

This isn't just a system change—it's proof that better processes 
beat hiring. We're going hospital-wide starting Week 12.

Your feedback designed this. Your adoption made it work.
Your commitment to patients made it matter.

Thank you."
```

**Weeks 10–12: Rollout Prep**
- Extended training for evening/night shifts
- Refresh for day-shift staff (ongoing refresher modules)
- Expanded dispatch rules for low-volume night shifts
- Governance transition: pilot mode → ops BAU

## Messaging Framework

### Core Messages (Repeat Across All Communications)

**1. Data-Driven Decision**
> "We analyzed 15,000 visits and found the real bottleneck: not staffing, but patient-to-doctor assignment."

**2. Process Improvement, Not Blame**
> "The queue is a system issue, not a people issue. This fix benefits patients AND staff."

**3. Speed & Scale**
> "Fast to implement (12 weeks), big impact ($5–6M upside), low risk (pilot first)."

**4. Patient Centricity**
> "Patients wait 70% less. Doctors spend more time with patients, less time coordinating."

**5. Staff Empowerment**
> "You keep all clinical decisions. We're just removing administrative friction."

## FAQ Document (For All Stakeholders)

### General Questions

**Q: Why are we changing things? Isn't ER already busy?**
A: ER is busy *because of bottlenecks*, not because we're at capacity. Data shows doctors are only 50% utilized during peak wait times. That means patients aren't reaching doctors fast enough. This fixes the routing, not the workload.

**Q: How long will this take to show results?**
A: We'll see improvements within 2–3 weeks of the pilot launch. Full benefits after 8–12 weeks.

**Q: Will this make my job harder?**
A: No. It removes manual coordination work (asking "who's next?" paging). You'll see your queue in real-time and spend more time with patients, less time coordinating.

---

### Clinical Questions

**Q: Does the computer make clinical decisions?**
A: No. The system suggests the next patient; you decide if that's right. If you see a different priority, you override. Clinical judgment stays with you 100%.

**Q: What if the queue system fails?**
A: We have a fallback. If the system goes down, we revert to manual coordination (what we do today). No impact on patient care.

**Q: How do I know it's safe?**
A: The dispatch rules were designed by your clinical team. Patient safety is rule #1. We have a safety officer reviewing every decision and weekly safety huddles.

---

### Staff Adoption Questions

**Q: Do I have to change how I work?**
A: Some workflow changes: checking queue board instead of asking people, accepting/overriding system suggestions instead of manual assignment. But your core clinical work stays the same.

**Q: What if I don't feel comfortable with the new system?**
A: Training is mandatory but thorough. You'll get hands-on practice before go-live, a quick-ref card at your desk, and support during the first week. Ask questions anytime.

**Q: Will I be judged if I struggle with the system?**
A: No. Pilot is a learning phase. We'll iterate based on your feedback. There's no penalty for struggling—that's why we pilot.

---

### Leadership Questions

**Q: What's the financial upside?**
A: $5–6M annually from 25–35% throughput improvement (40–58 additional patients/day). Investment is $840K; payback is <3 weeks.

**Q: What's the risk?**
A: Pilot risk is low (12 weeks, one shift, revert easily). Main risk is staff adoption (mitigated by training + change mgmt). Financial risk is minimal (payback fast).

**Q: When do we scale?**
A: Only after pilot succeeds (KPIs + safety + adoption targets met). Full rollout takes 8–12 more weeks (phased by shift).
