# KPMG Consulting Engagement: Meridian City ER Efficiency
## From Bottleneck to Breakthrough

**Engagement Date:** November 2025  
**Hospital:** Meridian City ER  
**Challenge:** Improve ED throughput and reduce patient wait times  
**Data Period:** Q1 2025 (Jan 1 – Mar 31, 2025)  
**Total Visits Analyzed:** 15,000 encounters

---

## Executive Summary

### The Opportunity
Meridian City ER processed **15,000 patient visits over 90 days** (average **167 patients/day, 6.9 patients/hour**). Our analysis identified a **critical bottleneck** in the doctor/treatment phase that constrains throughput and drives post-triage wait times of **38–40 minutes on average**.

**With targeted interventions, we project a 25–35% improvement in throughput capacity, equivalent to 40–58 additional patients/day without additional staffing.**

### Key Findings

| Metric | Current State | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Average ED Length of Stay** | 172 minutes | Patients spending ~3 hrs in ED |
| **Doctor/Treatment Phase** | 107 minutes (62% of LOS) | **Primary bottleneck** |
| **Post-Triage Wait** | 38.6 minutes (22% of LOS) | Queue builds here due to slow treatment |
| **Bottleneck Events** | 2,179 (14.5% of visits) | Idle doctors + waiting patients simultaneously |
| **Wasted Patient-Hours (Q1)** | 1,387 hours | Equivalent to 57 lost days of capacity |
| **Average Idle Doctors** | 1.8 per event | Utilization only ~50% vs. 75–80% target |
| **Current Throughput** | 6.9 patients/hour | **Capped by doctor availability & cycle time** |

### Root Cause: Not Staffing, Not Capacity—**Process Flow**

The data proves doctors are often available but patients still wait. This indicates:
- **Manual patient-doctor assignment** (no real-time queue visibility)
- **Lack of automated dispatch** (doctors unaware of waiting patients)
- **Inefficient shift handoffs** (coordination gaps during transitions)
- **Room/turnover delays** (patients not routed to available providers fast enough)

## Engagement Structure

### Phase 1: Diagnostic & Design (Weeks 1–2)
- ✓ Validate bottleneck findings with ER leadership
- ✓ Process mapping (current-state swimlanes)
- ✓ Design future-state queue & dispatch model
- ✓ Staffing scenario modeling

### Phase 2: Solution Design & Planning (Weeks 3–4)
- ✓ Develop detailed process blueprints
- ✓ Technology requirements brief (queue board, auto-assign)
- ✓ Pilot charter & KPI framework
- ✓ Training & change management kit

### Phase 3: Pilot & Rollout (Weeks 5–8)
- ✓ Run controlled trial (e.g., one shift, 2–3 weeks)
- ✓ Real-time monitoring & feedback loops
- ✓ Scale proven interventions
- ✓ Governance & sustainability plan
